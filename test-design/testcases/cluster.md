## Test Title: Clusters Resource Type - Basic Workflow Validation

### Description

This test validates that the workflow can work correctly for clusters resource type. It verifies that when a cluster resource is created via the HyperFleet API, the system correctly processes the resource through its lifecycle, required adapters (configured in the test config) execute successfully, and accurately reports status transitions back to the API. The test validates required adapters first to identify specific failures, then confirms the cluster reaches the final Ready and Available state. This approach ensures the complete workflow of CLM can successfully handle clusters resource type requests end-to-end.

### Preconditions

1. Environment is prepared using [hyperfleet-infra](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-infra) with all required platform resources
2. HyperFleet API and HyperFleet Sentinel services are deployed and running successfully
3. The adapters defined in testdata/adapter-configs are all deployed successfully 

---

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Submit an API request to create a Cluster resource

**Action:**
- Submit a POST request to create a Cluster resource:
```bash
curl -X POST ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @testdata/payloads/clusters/cluster-request.json
```

**Expected Result:**
- Response includes the created cluster ID and initial metadata
- Initial cluster conditions have `status: False` for both condition `{"type": "Ready"}` and `{"type": "Available"}`

#### Step 2: Verify initial status of cluster
**Action:**
- Poll cluster status for initial response
```bash
curl -X GET ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Cluster `Ready` condition `status: False`
- Cluster `Available` condition `status: False`

#### Step 3: Verify required adapter execution results

**Action:**
- Retrieve adapter statuses information:
```bash
curl -X GET ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/statuses
```

**Expected Result:**
- Response returns HTTP 200 (OK) status code
- All required adapters from config are present in the response:
  - `clusters-namespace`
  - `clusters-job`
  - `clusters-deployment`
- Each required adapter has all required condition types: `Applied`, `Available`, `Health`
- Each condition has `status: "True"` indicating successful execution
- **Adapter condition metadata validation** (for each condition in adapter.conditions):
  - `reason`: Non-empty string providing human-readable summary of the condition state
  - `message`: Non-empty string with detailed human-readable description
  - `last_transition_time`: Valid RFC3339 timestamp of the last status change
- **Adapter status metadata validation** (for each required adapter):
  - `created_time`: Valid RFC3339 timestamp when the adapter status was first created
  - `last_report_time`: Valid RFC3339 timestamp when the adapter last reported its status
  - `observed_generation`: Non-nil integer value equal to 1 for new creation requests

**Note:** Required adapters are configurable via:
- Config file: `configs/config.yaml` under `adapters.cluster`
- Environment variable: `HYPERFLEET_ADAPTERS_CLUSTER` (comma-separated list)

#### Step 4: Verify final cluster state

**Action:**
- Wait for cluster Ready condition to transition to True
- Retrieve final cluster status information:
```bash
curl -X GET ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Cluster `Ready` condition transitions from `status: False` to `status: True`
- Final cluster conditions have `status: True` for both condition `{"type": "Ready"}` and `{"type": "Available"}`
- Validate that the observedGeneration for the Ready and Available conditions is 1 for a new creation request
- This confirms the cluster has reached the desired end state

#### Step 5: Cleanup resources

**Action:**
- Delete the namespace created for this cluster:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace {cluster_id}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Namespace and all associated resources are deleted successfully

**Note:** This is a workaround cleanup method. Once CLM supports DELETE operations for "clusters" resource type, this step should be replaced with:
```bash
curl -X DELETE ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}
```

## Test Title: Clusters Resource Type - K8s Resources Check Aligned with Preinstalled Clusters Related Adapters Specified

### Description

This test verifies that Kubernetes resources are successfully created with correct templated values for all required cluster adapters. The test dynamically reads the list of required adapters from config, waits for each adapter to complete execution, then validates that corresponding Kubernetes resources (Namespace, Job, Deployment) exist with properly rendered metadata (labels, annotations) matching the cluster request payload. This ensures adapter Kubernetes resource management and templating work correctly across all configured adapters.

### Preconditions

1. Environment is prepared using [hyperfleet-infra](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-infra) with all required platform resources
2. HyperFleet API and HyperFleet Sentinel services are deployed and running successfully 
3. The adapters defined in testdata/adapter-configs are all deployed successfully

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Submit an API request to create a Cluster resource

**Action:**
- Submit a POST request to create a Cluster resource:
```bash
curl -X POST ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @testdata/payloads/clusters/cluster-request.json
```

**Expected Result:**
- Response includes the created cluster ID and initial metadata
- Initial cluster conditions have `status: False` for both condition `{"type": "Ready"}` and `{"type": "Available"}`

#### Step 2: Wait for all required adapters to complete

**Action:**
- Poll adapter statuses until all required adapters complete execution:
```bash
curl -X GET ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/statuses
```

**Expected Result:**
- All required adapters from config (cl-namespace, cl-job, cl-deployment) are present
- Each adapter has all three conditions (`Applied`, `Available`, `Health`) with `status: True`

**Note:** Required adapters are configurable via `configs/config.yaml` under `adapters.cluster`

#### Step 3: Verify Kubernetes resources for each adapter with correct metadata

**Action:**
- For each required adapter, retrieve and validate corresponding Kubernetes resources:

**For cl-namespace adapter:**
```bash
kubectl get namespace {cluster_id} -o yaml
```

**Expected Result:**
- Namespace exists with name matching the cluster ID
- Namespace status phase is `Active`
- Required annotations:
  - `hyperfleet.io/generation`: Equals "1" for new creation request

**For cl-job adapter:**
```bash
kubectl get job -n {cluster_id} -l hyperfleet.io/cluster-id={cluster_id},hyperfleet.io/resource-type=job -o yaml
```

**Expected Result:**
- Job exists in the cluster namespace, identified by the label selector
- Job has completed successfully (status.succeeded > 0 or status.conditions contains type=Complete with status=True)
- Required annotations:
  - `hyperfleet.io/generation`: Equals "1" for new creation request

**For cl-deployment adapter:**
```bash
kubectl get deployment -n {cluster_id} -l hyperfleet.io/cluster-id={cluster_id},hyperfleet.io/resource-type=deployment -o yaml
```

**Expected Result:**
- Deployment exists in the cluster namespace, identified by the label selector
- Deployment is available (status.availableReplicas > 0 and status.conditions contains type=Available with status=True)
- Required annotations:
  - `hyperfleet.io/generation`: Equals "1" for new creation request

#### Step 4: Cleanup resources

**Action:**
- Delete the namespace created for this cluster:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace {cluster_id}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Namespace and all associated resources are deleted successfully

**Note:** This is a workaround cleanup method. Once CLM supports DELETE operations for "clusters" resource type, this step should be replaced with:
```bash
curl -X DELETE ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}
```

## Test Title: Clusters Resource Type - Adapter Dependency Relationships Workflow Validation

### Description

This test validates that CLM correctly handles adapter dependency relationships when processing a clusters resource request. Specifically, it verifies the dependency relationship where the cl-deployment adapter depends on the cl-job adapter completion. The test continuously polls and validates throughout the workflow period to ensure: (1) cl-deployment's Applied condition remains False until cl-job's Available condition reaches True, enforcing the dependency precondition; (2) during cl-job execution, cl-deployment's Available condition stays Unknown (never False), confirming the adapter waits correctly without attempting execution; (3) successful completion with cl-deployment's Available eventually transitioning to True. This validation demonstrates that the workflow engine properly enforces adapter dependencies and ensures dependent adapters wait for prerequisites before executing.

### Preconditions

1. Environment is prepared using [hyperfleet-infra](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-infra) with all required platform resources
2. HyperFleet API and HyperFleet Sentinel services are deployed and running successfully 
3. The adapters defined in testdata/adapter-configs are all deployed successfully

---

### Test Steps

#### Step 1: Submit an API request to create a Cluster resource
**Action:**
- Submit a POST request to create a Cluster resource:
```bash
curl -X POST ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @testdata/payloads/clusters/cluster-request.json
```

**Expected Result:**
- API returns successful response

#### Step 2: Verify cl-deployment initial state and dependency waiting behavior

**Action:**
- Poll adapter statuses to capture cl-deployment's initial waiting state:
```bash
curl -X GET ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/statuses
```

**Expected Result:**
At the initial state (when cl-deployment first appears in statuses):
- Response returns HTTP 200 (OK) status code
- The `cl-deployment` adapter is present with initial waiting state:
  - `Applied` condition has `status: "False"` (deployment hasn't been applied yet, waiting for cl-job dependency)
  - `Available` condition has `status: "Unknown"` (deployment hasn't been applied yet)
  - `Health` condition has `status: "True"` (adapter itself is healthy, just waiting)

#### Step 3: Verify dependency relationship and condition transitions throughout entire workflow

**Action:**
- Continuously poll adapter statuses from the initial state until cl-deployment completes:
```bash
curl -X GET ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}/statuses
```

**Expected Result:**
Throughout the entire period (from initial state until cl-deployment completes), validate the following on each poll:

**Validation 1 - Dependency enforcement (during cl-job execution):**
- While `cl-job` adapter's `Available` condition has NOT reached `status: "True"`:
  - The `cl-deployment` adapter's `Applied` condition must remain `status: "False"`
  - The `cl-deployment` adapter's `Available` condition must remain `status: "Unknown"` (never `status: "False"`)
  - This validates that cl-deployment waits for cl-job to complete without attempting to apply resources

**Validation 2 - Success condition:**
- Once `cl-job` adapter's `Available` reaches `status: "True"`, cl-deployment can proceed with execution
- Once `cl-deployment` completes execution, its `Available` condition eventually becomes `status: "True"`
- This confirms the complete dependency workflow succeeded

**Note:** After cl-job completes, cl-deployment's `Available` condition may temporarily be `False` (e.g., `MinimumReplicasUnavailable` during deployment startup) before becoming `True`, which is expected behavior and not validated.

#### Step 4: Cleanup resources

**Action:**
- Delete the namespace created for this cluster:
```bash
kubectl delete namespace {cluster_id}
```

**Expected Result:**
- Namespace and all associated resources are deleted successfully

**Note:** This is a workaround cleanup method. Once CLM supports DELETE operations for "clusters" resource type, this step should be replaced with:
```bash
curl -X DELETE ${API_URL}/api/hyperfleet/v1/clusters/{cluster_id}
```
